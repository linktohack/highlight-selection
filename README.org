* highlight-selection
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yet another attempt to bring highlight selection to emacs.
#+END_QUOTE
Unlike other attempts, that highlight symbol-at-point using an idle
timer, this program advises `mouse-drag-region' to highlight
current selection, that means that user will be able to
double-click a word, or manually section a symbol, then all
occurrences of that word/symbol will be highlighted. The highlight
will be remove when user select a blank space or new line.

Works best with ~evil-search~.
* Example:
- Select a word to highlight
- Double-click to highlight
- Double-click beyond end of line to remove highlight
* Installation
Remove =:load-path= if the package is installed via =package.el=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'use-package)
(use-package highlight-selection
  :load-path "/path/to/highlight-selection/"
  :diminish highlight-selection-mode
  :demand
  :config (highlight-selection-mode 1)
  :bind (("s-e" . highlight-selection-current-selection)))
#+END_SRC
